# Private Inference

## App Demo

The folder `app/` contains code for a demo app that patients can use to get their diagnosis, provided they possess a digital copy of their scan.

The app can launched by downloading the folder and running `python app_private.py`. The app will accept any image from the diabetic retinopathy dataset as input (a few example inputs are provided in the folder) and will produce an output, as per the demo video below:
